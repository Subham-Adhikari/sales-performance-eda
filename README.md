## 🔍 Key Findings

### 💡 Customer Concentration Risk
> **Top 10% of customers generated 40% of total revenue**

This indicates significant dependency on a small customer base, presenting both an opportunity (focus on high-value retention) and a risk (vulnerability to customer churn).

### 🚴 Product Category Dominance
> **Bikes category contributed 96% of revenue** with an average order value of **$1,061**

Strong product-market fit but highlights potential over-reliance on a single category, suggesting need for product diversification.

### 📦 Operational Excellence
> **7-day average shipping time** with **100% on-time delivery rate**

Demonstrates efficient logistics operations and strong fulfillment capabilities.

## 💼 Business Recommendations

1. **Customer Retention Program**  
   Implement targeted retention strategies for top 10% high-value customers to protect 40% of revenue

2. **Customer Acquisition Strategy**  
   Diversify customer base to reduce concentration risk and dependency on small customer segment

3. **Product Diversification**  
   Expand beyond Bikes category to reduce 96% revenue dependency on single product line

4. **Leverage Operational Strength**  
   Maintain and market 100% on-time delivery as competitive advantage in customer acquisition

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### SQL Techniques Used:

- **Multi-table Joins**: Connected fact and dimension tables (`fact_sales`, `dim_customers`, `dim_products`)
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Structured complex queries for customer revenue aggregation
- **Window Functions**: Used `RANK` and `PERCENT_RANK` for customer segmentation analysis
- **Aggregations**: `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT` with `GROUP BY` for performance metrics
- **Data Quality Handling**: Excluded 19 invalid records with missing order dates to ensure analysis accuracy
